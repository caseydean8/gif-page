This page utilizes ajax and the giphy.com api to download 10 gifs to a webpage. 

The page comes with  3 categories pre-set, and it also allows the user to create a category. 

The gifs are downloaded and displayed as still images. They can be played after a user clicks on them, and can also be stopped on a second click.
